Why TypeScript + React

with static type checking you get to learn about potential bugs as you are typing the code than
heading to the browser and figuring out at runtime .

provide a way to describe the shape of an object hence providing better documentation and 
autocomplete

Makes maintenance and refactoring of large code bases much easier


TypeScript is just frustating most of the times.
 i have to write a lot more code than i normally do and the compiler keeps complaining I simply
 dont know what to do about those error .

 it does not seem to be productive for me.
